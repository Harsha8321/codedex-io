## Project Breakdown

### 1. Data Hoarding

- **Cities**: We've got a list of cities that have hosted the Olympics. Pretty lit, right?
- **Sports**: Every sport that’s ever been in the Olympics. 🏀🥋⛷️
- **Regions**: All the regions that throw down in the Olympics.

### 2. Data Wrangling

### 3. Web Magic

- Built a slick web app with Flask:
  - `index.html`: Your starting point. Shows all the sports.
  - `login.html`: Secure login page for accessing the dashboard.
  - `view_insights.html`: Overview with key insights and highlights.

### 4. Visual Treats

### 5. Prediction Power

- I’ve got a Random Forest Classifier ready to predict some future sports action. 🌟
- Not integrated into the web app yet, but you can check out the `notebook.ipynb` file for all the juicy details and code.

## What’s Next

- Add more detailed datasets for even crazier insights.
- Integrate the Random Forest Classifier into the web app for live predictions.
